                        (3) Decrypt/Encrypt

- automatically check keybase/sqlite3 installation status and run them up if necessary
- save password artifacts with keybase encryption saltpack or directly in sqlite (too big?)
- use sqlite3 as DB to manage usernames and servcies entries
- create a new password entry in DB and point to saltpack file
- use keybase to decrypt the password artifact if user want to view it, will be copied to clipboard
- search in command line about one or multiple password/other secrets using fuzzy criterias
- change a password or generate a password automatically
