# known issues

First this password string, @#$^[[1;2S!EASDF, caused print issue:
then I found more, like this one: @#$^%^&^&&&^[[19;2~*%@,
Ok, apparently ,it's a language encoding issue that ^@ or similar things won't be interpreted correct by UTF-8 pages; but wait... there are other issues `^[`or similar stuffs are all control characters that are not printable.
